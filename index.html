      <h1>HandIn Webpage Responsive Redesign</h1>
    </div>

    <div> <h2>Redesign Backstory/Context</h2>
        <p> Background:
            Though I was born in New York City, I spent my early childhood growing up in Cape Coast,Ghana where most of my family lives (everyone except my mum and brother). 
            And though I love New York, I often long for a sense of Ghana. Particularly, the traditional Ghanaian foods my mum cooks brings back memories. 
            My mum is often busy at work and when she did not have to cook growing up, we often went to Papaye Restaurant, a small family-run Ghanian restaurant 
            a few blocks from our apartment in the Bronx. 
        </p>

        <p> <h2>Redesign Purpose and Key Problems</h2>I wanted to redesign a website that I had a special connection to and couldn't think of a better one than Papaye's. Papaye's site
            was developed in 2006 according to publishing year on the site, and seems to have had little upkeep since. The main problem with the Home page of the 
        site is that the pictures of food that are meant to communicate the virbancy of the food and the culture don't actually load so it is just a lot of black background.
    Aditionally, the script on the site is pretty flashy and has headings that spin in and with the lack of photos, it doesn't make much sense. Also, the site's black 
background color is really dark and doesn't give an inviting sense and creates issues as it lacks contrast. </p>

<p> <h3>Accessiibility</h3> In terms of accessibility, the original design does a good job of utilizing aria labels. However, the lack of images and alt tags and low contrast because of the black background 
     might make the site inaccessible for people with visual problems. The site is also not compatible for mobile devices such as phones and tablets as the page is not 
responsive which creates another point of inaccessibiltiy for users who might only own a mobile device and not a laptop. Below is a link and screenshot of the website's homepage which I chose to redesign.

    <h2>Sketches and low-fidelity wireframes</h2>
    <p> Below are my 9 design sketches for possible redesigns</p>
    <img src="screenshots/9 sketches.jpeg" width="800px" height="600px"> 
    <p>Below is my final sketch for the redesign. I used a white background and red logo banner and centered 
        a vibrant photo of traditional Ghanian food.

    <p> I then made wireframes of my design explaining the main components and how the design looks on a laptop, phone, and tablet. See below</p>

<h2>Hi-Fi Mockups</h2>
<p>I made figma mockups of my homepage redesign and how it would look on the three devices. </p>

<h2>Style Guide Design Principles, Layout, Choice</h2>
<p> Style Guide:
    (I ended up changing the color palette slightly from the figma design because my red and white original colors lacked contrast. I also ended up adding 2 buttons in my actual design)

    Navigation Bar buttons and View on Map Buttons: “Courier New”
    About Section Info: “Courier New”
    Hours and Locations Info: “Marcellus SC” 
    
    Colors:
    Main Restaurant Logo banner background-color: rgb(252, 239, 216)
    Papaye Logo, Navigation bar Buttons: RED
    Body background color: white
    
    Common buttons/assets:
    NavBar:
    NavBar utilizes a flat design. “ABOUT,” “HOURS & LOCATIONS,” “ORDER ONLINE,” and “MENU” buttons are clickable. 
        About: on click —> scrolls to the About section
        Hours & Locations: on click → scrolls to Hours & Locations section at the bottom
        Order Online: on click —> navigates to Doordash order page

    <h3> How I fixed original page's issues and addressed accessibility</h3>
        <p> Importantly, I wanted to fix contrast issues and 
            create a lighter background against which the vibrant photos of traditional Ghanaian and African dishes would really pop out. I chose a light yellow, red, and white
            color palette and used the yellow and red only for the restaurant's logo at the top and the hours and locations banner at the bottom. Against the yellow and white background
            I used bold and fun red text to ensure contrast and consistency in design. 
            This establishes a clear palette and good contrast for accessibility. The buttons right at the top
            give users everything they need to know about the site right away and gives them options to easily navigate. The buttons utilize flat design to add to the sleek look: 
        </p>
        <img id="headerSc "src="screenshots/Screen Shot 2024-03-06 at 11.08.58 PM.jpeg" width="900px" height="200px"></img>
        <img id="hoursBanner" src="screenshots/Screen Shot 2024-03-06 at 11.09.04 PM.jpeg" width="900px" height="200px"> </img>

        <p>In between the site's colorful logo at the top and the hours and location banner at the very bottom of the site, I set a white background to 
            create a simple and clean look. This creates a clear hieararchy where the images of food are framed by the restaurant's logo and information
            on how to visit it. Atop the white background, I chose a couple of vibrant images of Ghanian food to contrast the plain background around it 
            and also to display the cuisine This addresses the low contrast issue and lack of images on the original site. In terms of improving accessibility, I also use aria labels and alt tags on 
            my images and buttons. I also used a WAVEAIM acceisbility to check that my color palette was accessible and good. In the main image 
            componenet that loads right away on the site, I decided to have images update with food to show the variety of food so users wouldnt have to look far. The screenshots
            below demonstrate how the color palettes and top and bottom banners (restaurant logo and hours and locations, respectively), work to frame the vibrant images of the food gallery against 
            a white background.

        <h3>Conclusion </h3>
        <p> Overall, I am happy with the design and though my final product differed a little from my original designs. My redesign creates a more modern feeling, utilizes light colors to create contrast with the vibrant images of the food, and utilizes alt tags and aria labels to be more accessible to people who might have visual issues.</p>
